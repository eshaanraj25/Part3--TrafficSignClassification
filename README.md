## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

In this project, we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. A model has been trained and validated so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, it is tested on traffic sign images found on the internet.

The project contains three files:

* The code is present in the [Ipython notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).
* The notebook exported in [html format](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html).
* The [writeup](writeup.md) contains a detailed information on the project.

Getting Started
---

The project has been developed on Windows 10 machine with Python 3.8.8. Download Python and follow the instructions ahead for the installation.

## Prerequistes
Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dataset
---

The dataset has been provided by Udacity. It is the [German Traffic Signs Dataset](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) resized the to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.

Usage
---

The project has been written in a Jupyter notebook. Run the Jupyter notebook environment and run the notebook `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`

To run Jupyter notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
